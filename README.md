**VisJudgeBench: Aesthetics and Quality Assessment of Visualizations**

## üéØ About VisJudgeBench

VisJudgeBench is a comprehensive benchmark dataset for visualization quality assessment based on the **"Fidelity-Expressiveness-Aesthetics"** evaluation framework. We release the complete dataset with **3,090 expert-annotated samples** across three categories (`single_vis`, `multi_vis`, `dashboard`), where each sample includes visualization images, six-dimensional quality scores, and evaluation prompts.

  <p><em>Why we need specialized visualization assessment: MLLMs excel at general aesthetics but struggle with visualization-specific evaluation</em></p>

## üîç Evaluation Framework

Our benchmark evaluates visualizations across three fundamental dimensions, operationalized into six measurable metrics:

</div>

**1. Fidelity - Data Accuracy and Truthfulness**

- `data_fidelity`: Evaluates whether visual encodings accurately reflect the original data, avoiding misleading interpretations caused by improper axis settings, scale distortions, or other design flaws.

**2. Expressiveness - Information Clarity and Understandability**

- `semantic_readability`: Assesses the clarity of basic information encoding and whether users can unambiguously decode visual elements.
- `insight_discovery`: Evaluates the effectiveness in revealing deep data patterns, trends, or outliers, helping users transition from "reading information" to "gaining insights".

**3. Aesthetics - Visual Aesthetics and Refinement**

- `design_style`: Measures the innovation and uniqueness of design, including novel visual elements and distinctive style.
- `visual_composition`: Focuses on the rationality of spatial layout, evaluating the balance and order of element positioning, size proportions, and spacing arrangements.
- `color_harmony`: Assesses the coordination and functionality of color combinations, ensuring color palette choices balance aesthetics with effective information communication.

## üèóÔ∏è Benchmark Construction

Our benchmark follows a rigorous three-stage construction pipeline to ensure high-quality annotations:

## üèÜ Benchmark Results

We systematically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on VisJudgeBench to assess their visualization quality assessment capabilities.

### ü§ñ Can MLLMs Assess Visualization Quality and Aesthetics Like Humans?

| Model              | MAE ‚Üì          | MSE ‚Üì          | Correlation ‚Üë  |

### üìä Do MLLMs Exhibit Human-like Scoring Behaviors?

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/score_distribution_density_for_paper.jpg" alt="Score Distribution" width="90%">
  <p><em>Rating patterns of different models compared to human experts (Œº<sub>human</sub>=3.13)</em></p>
</div>

**Systematic Biases Revealed:**

- **Score Inflation**: Most models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B Œº=3.89, Claude-3.5-Sonnet Œº=3.87) tend to over-rate visualizations
- **Overly Conservative**: Gemini-2.5-Pro (Œº=3.02) tends to under-rate visualizations
- **Perfect Alignment**: VisJudge (Œº=3.11) achieves near-perfect alignment with human rating distribution (Œº=3.13)

### üìà How Does Visualization Complexity Affect Model Performance?

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/model_performance_comparison_radar.jpg" alt="Model Performance Radar Chart" width="90%">
  <p><em>Model-human rating correlation across different visualization types and evaluation dimensions</em></p>
</div>

**Key Insights:**

- All models show **performance degradation** as complexity increases: Single Vis > Multi Vis > Dashboard
- VisJudge maintains the **best performance** across all types: 0.577 (Single), 0.565 (Multi), 0.375 (Dashboard)
- **Aesthetic dimensions** (especially Visual Composition) are most challenging in complex dashboards

### üîç How Do Model Evaluation Behaviors Differ in Practice?

Our case studies reveal two common biases in model evaluation behaviors: **score inflation** and **overly conservative** assessments.

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/casestudy_new.jpg" alt="Score Inflation Examples" width="100%">
  <p><em>Model evaluation examples on low-quality visualizations showing score inflation bias</em></p>
</div>

**Score Inflation:** For a chaotic treemap (human rating: 1.67), baseline models give inflated scores. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL-7B (3.67) praises its "clear legend" while ignoring the confusing layout, and Claude-4-Sonnet (3.08) incorrectly highlights "excellent spatial organization". In contrast, VisJudge's score of 2.00 aligns with human judgment, correctly identifying the "chaotic layout" that impairs interpretation.

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/case3.jpg" alt="Conservative Bias Examples" width="100%">
  <p><em>Case study highlighting the conservative bias of Gemini-2.5-Pro</em></p>
</div>

**Overly Conservative:** Conversely, Gemini-2.5-Pro exhibits overly conservative bias. For a high-quality dashboard rated 4.17 by humans, Gemini-2.5-Pro gives a disproportionately low score of 2.94, focusing on a single data inconsistency while overlooking the chart's overall effectiveness. Similarly, for another chart (human rating: 3.56), it scores only 2.33 due to the use of dual Y-axes. VisJudge demonstrates more balanced evaluations (3.83 and 3.00, respectively).

## üìã Data Format

The dataset is stored in JSON format (`VisJudgeBench.json`), where each entry contains the following fields:

- **`_id`**: Unique identifier for each sample
- **`type`**: Visualization category (`single_vis`, `multi_vis`, or `dashboard`)
